# Why this matters

In 2023, a broad coalition of AI researchers and lab leaders signed a plain, one-sentence warning:

> “Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war.”

Source: Center for AI Safety; “Statement on AI Risk” (2023): https://safe.ai/work/press-release-ai-risk

[I. J. Good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I._J._Good), one of the earliest voices to describe an “intelligence explosion,” put it in a single sentence:

> “Thus the first ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever make, **provided that the machine is docile enough to tell us how to keep it under control**.”


# Become a City Lead

This project helps volunteers run calm, nonpartisan AI awareness outreach at recurring local events (community events, art walks, farmers markets, campus fairs, conferences). Sponsors provide standardized, high-quality tabling kits (flyers, QR cards, stickers, signage) and a QR landing page; City Leads do the on-the-ground work and report simple metrics so the model can improve and scale.

If you can show up consistently and talk to strangers with respect, and you believe the path to **artificial superintelligence (ASI)** should not be dictated by a small handful of executives without public accountability, you can do this.

## Why local events like this are needed
Right now, most communities do not have a visible, approachable “front door” for AI risk and governance questions. People tend to encounter AI through headlines, social media arguments, or product hype; that is not a good way to build shared understanding. Meanwhile, policy and civic institutions usually move slower than technology, and local leaders often hear from constituents only when an issue becomes a crisis.

Community events help because they:
- reach people who will never seek out AI safety topics on their own
- create low-pressure first exposure (short explanation, QR link, respectful conversation)
- build local legitimacy (“normal people are talking about this”)
- create a feedback loop for better messaging (what questions are people actually asking?)

## You do not have to be convinced about “existential risk”
Many people do not see AI as an existential threat; some are unsure; some disagree strongly. City Leads do not need to “win” that argument.

The purpose of tabling is to:
- raise awareness that serious experts and institutions debate AI’s long-term risks and governance needs
- help people form an informed view at their own pace
- offer credible resources and next steps
- capture the public’s real questions so messaging improves and sponsors can learn

If your posture is curiosity, humility, and respect, you are a fit.

## What City Leads do
City Leads handle operations in their city:
- Identify a recurring local event with reliable foot traffic (monthly is ideal).
- Secure a booth or informational table slot.
- Staff the table (solo is fine; two people is better).
- Use sponsor-provided materials as-is; do not modify messaging or add unapproved claims.
- Submit an After-Action Report within 72 hours of each event.

Recommended commitment:
- 2 to 3 events in 60 to 90 days.

## What City Leads do not do
- Do not debate people at the table; keep it informational and invite follow-up.
- Do not endorse candidates or parties.
- Do not collect sensitive personal data.
- Do not improvise statistics or claims.

## What you get (support)
Depending on sponsor availability, City Leads may receive:
- A sponsor-shipped tabling kit (flyers, QR cards, stickers, signage).
- A simple talk track (30 seconds, 2 minutes, 5 minutes) and FAQ.
- A mobile QR landing page and tracking links.
- A reporting template so your work is counted and helps improve the kit.

## What “good” looks like
You do not need to be a policy expert. You do need to be steady and consistent.

A strong City Lead:
- can commit to a monthly cadence
- communicates clearly and politely
- follows the playbook and uses approved materials
- reports results on time
- learns and improves from one event to the next

## How to get involved
1) Read the pitch: [`PITCH.md`](/pitch.md)
2) Read the sponsor model: [`SPONSORING.md`](/sponsoring.md)
3) Review the After-Action Report template: [`After-Action Report Template`](/metrics/after-action-report-template.md)
4) Open an issue in this repo titled:
   **City Pilot Request: <City, State>**

Include:
- the event(s) you want to target and cadence (monthly preferred)
- expected foot traffic (if known)
- whether you will staff solo or with others
- your 60 to 90 day commitment window
- confirmation you will submit an AAR after each event

## Outreach posture (what to say at the table)
Default opener:
- “We’re doing local, nonpartisan public awareness on AI. If you’re curious, scan this QR for a quick overview.”

If someone is skeptical:
- “That’s reasonable. We’re not here to argue; we’re here to share resources and collect questions people have.”

If someone wants to debate:
- “We try to keep the table informational. The QR links to longer-form resources you can review at your own pace.”
