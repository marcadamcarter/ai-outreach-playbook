# Get Involved

## Why this matters

In 2023, a broad coalition of AI researchers and lab leaders signed a plain, one-sentence warning:

> "Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war."

Source: Center for AI Safety; "Statement on AI Risk" (2023): https://safe.ai/work/press-release-ai-risk

[I. J. Good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I._J._Good), one of the earliest voices to describe an "intelligence explosion," put it in a single sentence:

> "Thus the first ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever make, **provided that the machine is docile enough to tell us how to keep it under control**."

## You can contribute at any effort level

This project has seven outreach modes. You don't need to commit to all of them — pick the one that fits your situation.

| Mode | What it takes | Good for |
|------|--------------|----------|
| [Individual Advocacy](playbooks/individual-advocacy.md) | A conversation | Anyone willing to raise the topic with people they know |
| [Static Presence](playbooks/static-presence.md) | 1–2 hours to place materials | Introverts; people with venue access |
| [Signal Actions](playbooks/signal-actions.md) | 15–30 minutes with a sign | People who want visible impact with minimal time |
| [Micro-Gatherings](playbooks/micro-gatherings.md) | 1–2 hours to host a discussion | People comfortable facilitating small groups |
| [Interactive Booths](playbooks/interactive-booths.md) | Half-day at an event | People who can commit to a monthly cadence (City Lead role) |
| [Institutional Touchpoints](playbooks/institutional-touchpoints.md) | Variable | People with institutional access or professional credibility |
| [Digital Amplification](playbooks/digital-amplification.md) | Async | People with web or content skills |

## You do not have to be convinced about "existential risk"

Many people do not see AI as an existential threat. Some are unsure. Some disagree strongly. Volunteers do not need to "win" that argument.

The purpose of outreach is to:
- Raise awareness that serious experts and institutions debate AI's long-term risks and governance needs
- Help people form an informed view at their own pace
- Offer credible resources and next steps
- Capture the public's real questions so messaging improves

If your posture is curiosity, humility, and respect, you are a fit.

## Why local outreach matters

Most communities do not have a visible, approachable entry point for AI risk and governance questions. People encounter AI through headlines, social media, and product hype — not a good foundation for shared understanding. Local outreach helps because it:
- Reaches people who will never seek out AI safety topics on their own
- Creates low-pressure first exposure
- Builds local legitimacy ("normal people are talking about this")
- Creates a feedback loop for better messaging

## What "good" looks like across all modes

You don't need to be a policy expert. You need to be steady and consistent.

A strong volunteer:
- Picks a mode that fits their situation and commits to it
- Uses approved materials and messaging without improvising claims
- Maintains an informational, nonpartisan posture
- Reports results so the system improves

---

## Outreach posture (all modes)

Default opener (adapt to context):
> "I'm sharing information about AI safety policy — it's a nonpartisan topic that doesn't get a lot of local coverage."

If someone is skeptical:
> "That's reasonable. I'm not here to convince you — just to make sure people know the issue exists."

If someone wants to debate:
> "We try to keep this informational. There's a good short overview at the link if you want to look at it on your own time."

---
