# Mode 4: Micro-Gatherings

**Effort: Low Scale · Reach: High Depth · Sponsor: Optional**

Small group engagement with structured discussion. Moves people from awareness to conviction. Develops future volunteers.

---

## When to Use This Mode

- You want to go beyond handing out flyers into real conversation
- You have access to a casual venue (coffee shop, library meeting room, church space)
- You're comfortable leading or co-leading a 10–15 minute structured talk
- You want to develop local advocates, not just informed bystanders

---

## Volunteer Requirements

- Facilitator: comfortable leading a brief structured conversation (not a lecture)
- 3–12 attendees is the ideal range; fewer than 3 loses energy, more than 12 loses depth
- Commitment: 1–2 hours total (prep + session); optional follow-up
- No expertise required — the structured format handles it

---

## Materials Kit

**Self-serve:**
- Printed discussion outline (1-page)
- Printed 1-page "start here" explainer for attendees
- Optional: simple slide deck (5–8 slides; see structure below)

**Sponsor-supported additions:**
- Professionally designed slide deck
- Printed handouts in quantity
- QR cards linking to curated reading list

### Slide Deck Structure (if used)
1. The speed of AI development (1 slide; 1–2 data points)
2. What's at stake (1 slide; human oversight framing)
3. What local action looks like (1 slide)
4. Discussion question (1 slide; leave on screen during discussion)
5. What you can do next (1 slide; QR + specific asks)

Keep the deck to 5–8 slides. Slides are a backdrop to conversation, not a replacement for it.

## Step-by-Step Setup

1. **Choose a format.** Options:
   - Invite-only: personal network, neighborhood group, faith community, workplace lunch
   - Open: posted to local Facebook group, Meetup, Nextdoor, library calendar
   - Hybrid: structured segment at an existing group's meeting

2. **Book a venue.** Coffee shop back room, library community room, church fellowship hall, someone's living room. Keep it informal — a formal venue raises the perceived barrier to attendance.

3. **Invite people.** For invite-only: personal message or email. For open: post with a single clear line: "30-minute conversation about AI policy and what it means locally." Avoid academic framing.

4. **Prepare your talk.** Use the 10–15 minute structure below. Print the discussion outline. Practice the opening question aloud.

5. **Run the session.** Start on time. Keep the talk segment to 10–15 minutes. Spend the remaining time on discussion. End with a concrete next step.

6. **Follow up.** Email attendees within 48 hours with the QR link and one specific ask (sign up as City Lead, share with one person, etc.).

## 10–15 Minute Session Structure

**Minutes 0–2: Framing**
> "Thanks for being here. This isn't a lecture and I'm not an expert — I'm just someone who thinks this topic deserves more local conversation. I want to share a few things, ask you one question, and then hear what you think."

**Minutes 2–8: Core content**
Cover these three points (adjust language to your audience):
1. AI systems are developing faster than the policy frameworks governing them.
2. The decisions being made now — about oversight, access, and control — will matter for decades.
3. Local voices have historically shaped national policy when they show up consistently.

Keep this section to facts and framing. Avoid predictions, doom narratives, or debates about specific AI systems.

**Minutes 8–10: Discussion question**
> "Here's what I want to ask the group: What happens if AI development outpaces our ability to understand and govern it — and what, if anything, do you think people like us should do about it?"

Let the group talk. Your job is to facilitate, not answer.

**Minutes 10–15: Concrete next step**
> "Whatever you think about this, the thing that seems to move the needle is showing up consistently — at the local level. Here's what that looks like." [show QR or handout]

Give one clear ask: attend a future event, sign up as a City Lead, or share with one person who would engage with this.

---

## Discussion Prompts (Backup)

If the group goes quiet after the opening question:
- "What would you want to know before trusting an AI to make a high-stakes decision?"
- "Do you think most people in this city know this conversation is happening?"
- "What's one thing you think local residents could realistically do?"

---

## Success Metrics

- Sessions run per month
- Attendees per session
- Conversion to City Lead or volunteer inquiry
- QR scans from session-specific cards
- Follow-up attendance at subsequent events

## AAR Notes

When filing your AAR for this mode:
- Venue type and format (invite-only, open, embedded)
- Attendee count and rough demographics
- Which discussion question generated the most response
- Any new volunteer inquiries
- What you'd change for the next session
