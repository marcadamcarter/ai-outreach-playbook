# Contact Elected Officials

Purpose: help City Leads quickly find and contact their elected officials to (1) inform them that a local AI outreach effort is underway, (2) invite staff to engage, and (3) share measured outcomes from events.

This is informational outreach. Keep it nonpartisan. Do not endorse candidates.

## What to ask for (keep it simple)
Pick one primary ask per outreach message:
1) Awareness: “We are running a local informational outreach effort; here is what it is.”
2) Staff touchpoint: “Who on your staff handles technology, AI, workforce, or public safety issues?”
3) Invite: “We can provide a short, nonpartisan briefing and share what we are hearing from the public.”
4) Follow-up: “Here are the results from our last event; here are the top questions we heard.”

## Suggested workflow
1) Identify your officials (federal, state, local).
2) Find the best contact method:
   - official web contact form
   - district office email
   - district office phone
3) Send an initial short note.
4) Log your outreach.
5) Follow up after each event with an after-action summary and a link to results.

## Email template: initial outreach (short)
Subject: Local community outreach; AI awareness and constituent questions

Hello [Title] [Last Name] and team,

I am a constituent in [City], and I am helping run a local, nonpartisan community outreach effort focused on AI-related public awareness. We are hosting informational booths at recurring community events and sharing a QR link to credible resources; we also capture high-level metrics (QR scans and common questions) to understand what the public is concerned about.

If there is a staff member who handles technology, AI, or workforce topics, I would appreciate the best point of contact. We can also offer a brief 15-minute overview of what we are doing locally and what questions we are hearing from constituents.

Thank you,
[Your name]
