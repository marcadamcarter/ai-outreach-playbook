# Mode 5: Digital Amplification

**Effort: Asynchronous · Reach: Unlimited Scale · Sponsor: Supported**

Every physical interaction should route here. Digital amplification multiplies the impact of every other mode.

---

## When to Use This Mode

- You want to extend the reach of physical outreach beyond the event
- You need a QR destination that's worthy of the curiosity you've generated
- You want to enable people to share the message in their own networks
- A sponsor is building or funding digital infrastructure

This mode is rarely standalone — it's the destination that all other modes point to.

## Volunteer Requirements

- Content curator: comfortable evaluating and selecting readable, non-academic sources
- Optional: someone with basic web skills to manage a landing page
- Sponsor-side: web hosting, QR generation, analytics access
- Commitment: initial setup + periodic content updates (monthly)

---

## Materials Kit

**Self-serve:**
- Curated link list (Google Doc or Notion page) shared via QR
- Short text explainer (see "Start Here Page" below)
- Social share snippets (3–5 pre-written posts for different platforms)

**Sponsor-supported:**
- Dedicated landing page with custom domain
- QR code generation with per-campaign tracking
- Analytics dashboard (scan rates, time on page, conversion)
- Short video (2–3 minutes; see structure below)

---

## Start Here Page (Required)

Every QR code in this system should point to a "Start Here" page. This page is the most important asset in the entire outreach system.

### Requirements
- 2–5 minute read maximum
- Written for a general audience; no academic jargon
- Non-partisan framing throughout
- One clear call to action at the bottom (sign up, share, attend an event)

### Structure
1. **The situation** (2–3 sentences): AI development is accelerating. Policy frameworks aren't keeping pace. This matters.
2. **Why it matters locally** (2–3 sentences): This isn't just a tech industry conversation. Local voices have shaped national policy before. They can again.
3. **What you can do** (3–5 bullet points): Attend an event. Share this page. Sign up as a City Lead. Contact your representative. Follow for updates.
4. **Trusted sources** (3–5 links): Curated reading list; non-academic; diverse sources.

### What to Avoid
- Long introductions about AI history
- Speculative doomsday scenarios
- Academic citations without explanation
- Embedded video as the only content (some users won't watch)

## Short Video Structure (Optional but High-Value)

If a sponsor funds a short video, use this structure:

1. **Hook (0–10 sec):** A question or provocative statement. "What if the most important decision of the next decade is happening without your input?"
2. **Problem (10–40 sec):** AI is moving fast. Oversight structures are lagging. Briefly.
3. **What people are doing (40–90 sec):** Show local outreach. Real people, low stakes, nonpartisan.
4. **Call to action (90–120 sec):** One ask. Link below.

Keep it under 3 minutes. Shoot on a phone if needed — authenticity beats production value for this audience.

## QR Code Strategy

- Use a unique QR code per campaign, location cluster, or event
- Route all QR codes through a redirect (not direct to final URL) so you can update destinations without reprinting
- Track scan rates by QR code to identify which physical placements drive the most engagement
- Review analytics monthly and retire underperforming placements

---

## Social Share Snippets

Pre-write 3–5 share-ready posts for different platforms. Give these to anyone who asks "how can I help spread the word?"

**Example (short form):**
> AI development is moving faster than the oversight systems governing it. Here's a 3-minute overview of what's happening and what local residents can do. [link]

**Example (conversational):**
> I've been learning about AI safety policy lately and it's more urgent than I realized. This page explains it without the jargon: [link]

Avoid: political framing, partisan language, doom predictions, or anything that requires the reader to already care.

## Success Metrics

- QR scan rate by code
- Time on Start Here page
- Click-through rate to call-to-action
- Social shares
- Conversion to City Lead or event sign-up
