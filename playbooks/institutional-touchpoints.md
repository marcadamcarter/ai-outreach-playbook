# Mode 7: Institutional Touchpoints

**Effort: High Leverage · Frequency: Lower · Sponsor: Optional**

Engagement with formal structures — elected officials, schools, civic organizations, professional associations. Influences decision-makers and legitimizes local efforts.

---

## When to Use This Mode

- You have access to a formal institution (city council, school, business group, civic org)
- You want to move from awareness-building to policy-adjacent influence
- You have a professional or academic background that gives you credibility in formal settings
- You want to give other outreach modes institutional legitimacy

---

## Volunteer Requirements

- Presenter or spokesperson: comfortable with formal briefing settings
- Optional: City Lead to coordinate logistics and submit AAR
- Commitment: varies by format (5-minute comment = 1 hour prep; school presentation = half-day)
- Credibility helps: professional background, local ties, or institutional affiliation

---

## Materials Kit

**Self-serve:**
- 1-page briefing document (see structure below)
- 5–10 minute talk (verbal; no slides required for informal settings)
- City council comment script (under 3 minutes; see below)

**Sponsor-supported additions:**
- Professional briefing deck (5–10 slides)
- Extended 30-minute version for organizational briefings
- Printed leave-behind for staff and decision-makers
- Speaker prep support

### Briefing Deck Structure (5–10 slides)
1. Who we are and why this matters locally
2. The speed of AI development (1–2 data points)
3. The oversight gap (current state of policy)
4. What other jurisdictions are doing
5. What we're asking / why this matters to your constituents
6. Contact and next steps

Keep credibility high: use sources, avoid hyperbole, acknowledge uncertainty.

## Institutional Contexts

### City Council and Local Government
Use public comment periods to raise AI oversight as a constituent concern. You don't need to ask for specific policy action — awareness-raising is sufficient at this stage.

See [contact-elected-officials.md](contact-elected-officials.md) for detailed scripts, email templates, and contact lookup resources.

**What to ask for:**
- Awareness: "I'd like to ensure your office is aware of this issue"
- Staff touchpoint: "Would a staff member be available for a 20-minute briefing?"
- Briefing invitation: "We'd welcome the opportunity to present to you or your staff"

### School Presentations
High school and college audiences are receptive and underserved on this topic.

**Approach:**
- Contact via department chair or civics/social studies teacher
- Frame as "current events" or "digital citizenship" — easier entry than "AI policy"
- Aim for 20–30 minutes with Q&A
- Use the Micro-Gatherings discussion structure adapted for younger audiences
- Leave a QR card for students to share

### Organizational Briefings
Professional associations, chambers of commerce, rotary clubs, faith leadership networks.

**Approach:**
- Request 10–15 minutes on an existing agenda rather than a standalone event
- Frame as relevant to the organization's interests (workforce, business risk, community)
- Prepare for the question: "What do you want us to do about it?" Have a concrete answer ready.

## City Council Comment Script (3 minutes)

> "My name is [name] and I'm a [city] resident. I'm here to ask that [council/mayor's office] become aware of the AI oversight conversation happening at the state and federal level and its potential impact on our community.
>
> AI systems are being deployed in ways that affect municipal services, employment, and public safety — often without adequate governance frameworks. Several cities and states are beginning to address this proactively.
>
> I'm not asking for specific policy action today. I'm asking that someone on your staff take 20 minutes to understand what's happening and be available to engage with residents on this topic.
>
> I'm happy to provide materials and follow up. Thank you."

Adapt for your city. Stay under 3 minutes. Be measured in tone.

3. **What other jurisdictions are doing** (2–3 bullet points): Concrete examples
4. **Our ask** (1–2 sentences): Specific, modest, actionable
5. **Contact information**
