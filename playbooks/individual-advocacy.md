# Mode 6: Individual Advocacy

**Effort: Zero Coordination · Reach: Personal Networks · Sponsor: Not Required**

For individuals who want to act independently — no event, no booth, no schedule. Remove the dependency on organized outreach and scale through personal networks.

---

## When to Use This Mode

- You want to contribute without attending events or coordinating with anyone
- You're comfortable raising AI safety as a topic in natural conversation
- You want to share information in your workplace, family, or friend group
- You're an introvert who prefers one-on-one over public-facing formats

This mode requires no sponsor, no kit, and no coordination. Everything you need fits in your pocket.

---

## Volunteer Requirements

- No facilitation skills required; just willingness to bring up the topic
- Commitment: none defined — contribute whenever it feels natural
- Works entirely solo

---

## Materials Kit

**Self-serve (everything you need):**
- 1-page explainer (printable or shareable as PDF)
- 3 talking points (memorize or keep on your phone)
- 1 short video link (2–3 minutes; shareable)
- 60-second explanation guide (verbal script; see below)

**Optional sponsor-supported additions:**
- Professionally printed wallet cards with QR
- Shareable digital card for texting or email

## The 3 Talking Points

These are your core message. Know all three; use one or two per conversation.

1. **The speed point:** AI systems are advancing faster than the regulatory and oversight structures designed to govern them. The gap is widening.

2. **The stakes point:** The decisions being made now — about who controls these systems, how they're used, and what limits exist — will shape outcomes for decades.

3. **The access point:** Most people don't know this conversation is happening at a policy level. Awareness itself is the first step.

## 60-Second Explanation Guide

Use this when someone asks "what do you mean by AI safety?" or when you want to introduce the topic naturally.

> "So AI development is moving really fast right now — faster than most people realize. The concern isn't just about sci-fi scenarios. It's more practical: the systems that are being built today are starting to make decisions that affect people, and the oversight structures — the policies, the laws, the accountability mechanisms — haven't kept up. That gap is what a lot of researchers and policy people are focused on. I've been trying to understand it better and thought it was worth raising."

Pause. See if they have questions. Don't push.

## Step-by-Step Approach

1. **Know your moment.** Good openings: when AI comes up naturally in conversation, when someone mentions ChatGPT or another AI tool, when news coverage creates an opening. Don't force it.

2. **Use a question, not a statement.** Questions invite conversation; statements invite defensiveness.
   - "Have you thought about who's responsible when an AI system makes a bad call?"
   - "Do you think most people understand how fast AI is developing?"
   - "I've been reading about AI oversight lately — do you follow that stuff at all?"

3. **Give a 60-second frame, then stop.** Don't lecture. Say your piece, then pause. Let them respond.

4. **Share the resource.** If they're interested: "There's a good short overview — I can send you the link."

5. **Don't argue.** If they're skeptical or dismissive, let it go. The goal is to plant the idea, not win the debate.

## Workplace Conversations

Workplace conversations require extra care around tone and boundaries. Guidelines:

- Frame as "something I've been reading about" not "something you should care about"
- Stick to the informational framing; avoid political or policy debates
- Don't bring it up repeatedly with the same person if they weren't receptive
- Lunch, hallway conversations, and Slack sidechannels are natural; staff meetings are not the right venue

---

## Digital Sharing

Sharing via text, email, or social media is a valid form of individual advocacy.

**High-signal sharing:**
- Direct message to someone you think would find it interesting
- Email with a brief personal note: "Thought you'd find this worth 3 minutes"
- Comment on a relevant post with a link and one-sentence framing

**Low-signal sharing:**
- Mass-posting without context
- Sharing to audiences that haven't opted into the topic
- Arguing in comment threads

Quality of share matters more than quantity.

---

## Success Metrics

Individual advocacy is the hardest mode to measure. Reasonable proxies:
- Conversations initiated per month (self-reported)
- Resources shared (links sent, cards handed out)
- Referrals to City Lead program or events

You don't need to track this formally unless you want to. The goal is contribution, not reporting.
