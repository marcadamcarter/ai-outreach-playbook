# Core Model: Outreach Modes

A modular outreach system with multiple deployment modes based on effort, cost, and reach.

---

## 1. Static Presence  
**Low effort · Passive reach**

No direct engagement required; relies on curiosity.

### Examples
- Flyers in coffee shops, libraries, campuses  
- QR code stickers on bulletin boards  
- Business card drops  
- Posters in high foot-traffic areas  

### Playbook Kit
- High-contrast posters; readable at 10–20 ft  
- Single clear action: “Understand AI Risk in 2 Minutes”  
- Minimal text; one idea per asset  

### Why It Matters
- Scales cheaply  
- Enables low-confidence or introverted participants  
- Builds baseline awareness  

---

## 2. Signal Actions  
**Very low effort · High visibility bursts**

Short-duration, high-visibility presence; your “corner sign” model.

### Examples
- Busy intersection sign holders  
- Overpass or banner displays where legal  
- Small group 15–30 minute “flash presence” sessions  

### Critical Success Factor
Legibility beats passion.

### Playbook Kit
- Professionally printed, bold signage  
- 3–5 word headlines max:
  - “AI Risk Is Real”  
  - “Pause Before It’s Too Late”  
  - “Who Controls Superintelligence?”  
- Optional secondary QR code  

### Rules
- Must be readable in 2 seconds at 40 mph  
- No paragraphs; no nuance  

### Why It Matters
- High visibility per minute invested  
- Fast message testing  

---

## 3. Interactive Booths  
**Moderate effort · Deep engagement**

Structured engagement at events.

### Examples
- Art walks  
- Flea markets  
- Festivals  

### Enhancement Opportunity
Shift from “information booth” to experience booth.

### Playbook Kit
- Clean visual hook; no clutter  
- One core question:
  - “Would you trust AI to run your city?”  
- 1-page handout  
- 2-minute explainer QR  
- Optional live demo  

### Why It Matters
- Converts curiosity into understanding  
- Builds conversations and local advocates

## 4. Micro-Gatherings  
**Low scale · High depth**

Small group engagement with structured discussion.

### Examples
- Coffee shop meetups  
- Library sessions  
- Church or small group discussions  
- Local user groups  

### Playbook Kit
- 10–15 minute structured talk  
- Discussion prompts:
  - “What happens if AI surpasses human control?”  
- Simple slide deck or printed outline  

### Why It Matters
- Moves people from awareness to conviction  
- Develops future volunteers

## 5. Digital Amplification  
**Asynchronous scale**

Every physical interaction should route here.

### Examples
- Localized landing pages  
- Short shareable videos  
- QR-driven starter page  
- Curated AI updates  

### Playbook Kit
- “Start Here” page; 2–5 minute read  
- Clean narrative; non-academic  
- Social share snippets  

### Why It Matters
- Multiplies physical outreach impact  
- Enables sustained engagement  

---

## 6. Individual Advocacy Kit  
**Zero coordination required**

For individuals who want to act independently.

### Examples
- Workplace conversations  
- Family and friend discussions  
- Personal sharing  

### Playbook Kit
- 1-page explainer  
- 3 talking points  
- 1 short video link  
- 60-second explanation guide  

### Why It Matters
- Removes dependency on events  
- Scales through personal networks  

---

## 7. Institutional Touchpoints  
**High leverage · Lower frequency**

Engagement with formal structures.

### Examples
- City council comment periods  
- School presentations  
- Organizational briefings  
- Chamber of commerce talks  

### Playbook Kit
- Professional briefing deck  
- 5–10 minute version  
- 30 minute extended version  
- Credible framing; measured tone  

### Why It Matters
- Influences decision-makers  
- Legitimizes local efforts

# Unifying Communication Principle

Most outreach fails because it is unreadable, unfocused, or overloaded.

## The 3-Layer Message Model

1. Hook; 2–5 words  
2. Core idea; one sentence  
3. Action; QR code or next step  

Assets that violate this model should be rejected.
