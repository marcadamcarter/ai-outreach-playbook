# Start Here

This repo is a modular outreach toolkit for local AI safety awareness. There are seven modes — each designed for a different effort level, situation, and type of volunteer.

You don't need to pick just one.

---

## Choose your mode

### "I have 30 minutes and want to do something today."

**[Mode 2: Signal Actions](playbooks/signal-actions.md)**
Grab a sign and stand at a busy corner for 15–30 minutes. No coordination required.

**[Mode 6: Individual Advocacy](playbooks/individual-advocacy.md)**
Have one conversation today — at work, with a friend, in a text message. Takes nothing but willingness.

---

### "I want to contribute passively without direct engagement."

**[Mode 1: Static Presence](playbooks/static-presence.md)**
Place flyers, QR stickers, or business cards in coffee shops, libraries, and campuses. Works while you're not there.

---

### "I want to run a local event or staff a booth."

**[Mode 3: Interactive Booths](playbooks/interactive-booths.md)**
Staff a table at a community event — art walk, farmers market, festival. This is the flagship mode. Sponsor kit support available.

---

### "I want to host a small group discussion."

**[Mode 4: Micro-Gatherings](playbooks/micro-gatherings.md)**
Organize a 30-minute conversation at a coffee shop, library, or living room. 3–12 people. Structured but informal.

---

### "I want to reach more people online or help build the digital layer."

**[Mode 5: Digital Amplification](playbooks/digital-amplification.md)**
Build or improve the QR destinations, landing pages, and shareable content that all other modes point to.

---

### "I have access to a formal institution — city council, school, civic org."

**[Mode 7: Institutional Touchpoints](playbooks/institutional-touchpoints.md)**
Engage elected officials, give school presentations, brief professional organizations. High leverage; lower frequency.
