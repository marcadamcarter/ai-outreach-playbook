# Start Here

This repo documents a simple, repeatable model for local AI risk awareness outreach at community events.

**The model**
- Sponsors ship high-quality tabling kits (flyers, QR cards, stickers, signage).
- Local City Leads run booths at recurring events (monthly preferred).
- Each event is measured via QR tracking and a short After-Action Report.
- Results improve the kit; the process replicates to other cities.
