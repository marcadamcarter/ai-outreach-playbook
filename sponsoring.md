# Sponsoring ai-outreach-playbook

## What sponsors do

Sponsors enable high-quality, measurable outreach without running operations themselves. Sponsors:
- Choose which modes to fund (one or many)
- Approve messaging once; ship standardized materials to vetted volunteers
- Provide QR landing pages and tracking infrastructure
- Receive structured reporting (QR scans, conversions, common questions, what worked)
- Iterate kits only when data suggests a clear improvement

Local volunteers — City Leads and individual advocates — handle all field operations.

## Why sponsor control matters

For any mode where a sponsor is involved, the sponsor controls:
- Message consistency (approved copy, claims, call-to-action)
- Visual quality (design, print clarity, durable materials)
- Brand posture (tone, disclaimers, what we do not say)
- Measurement (trackable QR codes tied to kit IDs and campaigns)

Volunteers focus on execution. Sponsors focus on quality.

## What sponsors can fund by mode

### Mode 1: Static Presence
Flyers, posters, QR sticker rolls, business cards. Optional: display stands, professionally printed corrugated signs, UV-coated posters.

### Mode 2: Signal Actions
Professionally printed corrugated plastic signs (24x36), vinyl banners with grommets, pre-printed sign inventory for regional deployment.

### Mode 3: Interactive Booths (flagship)
**Minimum viable Tabling Kit (physical):**
- Flyers (high-quality stock; 1 page)
- FAQ handout (1 page or half-sheet)
- QR cards (business-card size; durable stock)
- Stickers (optional but high engagement)
- Table signage (folding tabletop sign or rigid sign)
- Talk-track card for volunteers (30 seconds, 2 minutes, 5 minutes)
- Setup instructions and reporting checklist

Optional upgrades: retractable banner, branded tablecloth, volunteer shirts, "hard questions" card (volunteers only).

Each kit gets a version number (e.g., v1.2) and a kit ID for tracking and iteration.

### Mode 4: Micro-Gatherings
Professional slide deck (5–8 slides), printed handouts in quantity, QR cards for session follow-up, optional facilitator prep support.

### Mode 5: Digital Amplification
Dedicated landing page ("Start Here" page), QR code generation with per-campaign tracking, analytics dashboard, short video production (2–3 minutes), social share snippet library.

### Mode 6: Individual Advocacy
Professionally printed wallet cards with QR, shareable digital card templates for text/email distribution.

### Mode 7: Institutional Touchpoints
Professional briefing deck (5–10 slides), 30-minute extended version, printed leave-behind document, speaker prep support.

## Fulfillment models

Sponsors can choose what fits their organization:

### Option A: Direct fulfillment (small pilots)
Batch print kits; ship as requests come in. Works well for 5–25 kits.

### Option B: Print-and-fulfill vendor
Sponsor provides approved print files; vendor prints, packs, and ships. Keeps internal operations minimal; ideal for scaling.

### Option C: Hybrid
Sponsor ships only items that are hard to print locally (stickers, QR cards, signage); volunteers print low-cost flyers locally. Use only if full shipping is not feasible.

Recommended default: Option B.

## Sponsor support levels

### Level A: Single-mode pilot
- Fund one mode (typically Interactive Booths or Digital Amplification)
- Ship 5–10 kits to vetted volunteers
- Volunteer commits to 2–3 events in 60–90 days with AARs

### Level B: Kit + restock (active maintenance)
- Initial kit shipment
- Small refills (flyers, QR cards, stickers) after reporting thresholds are met
- Prevents volunteer burnout; keeps quality consistent over time

### Level C: Multi-mode campaign
- Fund multiple modes in a coordinated campaign
- Interactive Booths + Static Presence + Digital Amplification is a natural combination
- Volunteers can activate different modes based on their situation

### Level D: Multi-city campaign
- Ship kits to 10+ cities
- Standardized reporting; compare results across locations and modes
- Use results to decide whether to scale

## Quality and message governance

- All kits include a fixed version number and kit ID
- Volunteers agree not to alter messaging, make unapproved claims, or add partisan content
- Partner-specific branding and CTAs live under `/partners/<partner>/` and require explicit permission
- Logos and trademarks must not be used without written approval

---

## Volunteer requirements (to receive a sponsor kit)

A volunteer requesting sponsor materials agrees to:
- Run at least 2 events or placements in the committed window
- Use sponsor materials as provided; no modifications without approval
- Use sponsor-provided QR tracking links
- Submit an After-Action Report within 72 hours of each event (template in `/metrics/`)
- Avoid collecting sensitive personal data; keep signups opt-in and minimal
- Maintain an informational, nonpartisan posture

---

## Measurement and reporting

Each kit should include:
- A kit ID and default QR destination (with UTM parameters or equivalent)
- Per-event QR links (city + date + mode)

Minimum per-event metrics (all modes):
- Mode used
- Materials distributed (estimate)
- QR scans
- Conversions (as defined by sponsor goal)
- Top questions asked
- What worked; what didn't; changes for next time

Example restock threshold:
- 2 events completed
- 50 total QR scans
- 10 conversions
- AARs submitted for each event

---

## Cost posture

This playbook does not require large budgets. Sponsors can start with a small batch of high-quality kits. Restock can be conditional on demonstrated activity and reporting. The sustainable loop: ship kit → run events → capture metrics → refine materials → repeat.

## How to sponsor

Open a GitHub issue titled: **Sponsorship: \<Org Name\>**

Include:
- Which modes you want to support
- Preferred fulfillment model (A, B, or C)
- What the QR should drive (subscribe, join, donate, learn, etc.)
- Brand constraints (tone, topics to avoid, logo rules)
- How many kits you want to pilot

## How volunteers request kits

Open a GitHub issue titled: **City Pilot Request: \<City, State\>**

Include:
- Which mode(s) you want to run
- Target event(s) or placements, expected traffic, and cadence
- Staffing plan (solo or team)
- Commitment window (e.g., 60–90 days)
- Shipping address for physical kits
- Confirmation you will submit after-action reports
