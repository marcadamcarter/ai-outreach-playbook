# Sponsoring ai-outreach-playbook

## What sponsors do

Sponsors enable high-quality, measurable outreach without running operations themselves. Sponsors:
- Choose which modes to fund (one or many)
- Approve messaging once; ship standardized materials to vetted volunteers
- Provide QR landing pages and tracking infrastructure
- Receive structured reporting (QR scans, conversions, common questions, what worked)
- Iterate kits only when data suggests a clear improvement

## What sponsors can fund by mode

### Mode 1: Static Presence
Flyers, posters, QR sticker rolls, business cards. Optional: display stands, professionally printed corrugated signs.

## Fulfillment models

**Option A: Direct fulfillment** — Batch print and ship. Works for 5–25 kits.

**Option B: Print-and-fulfill vendor** — Sponsor provides files; vendor prints, packs, ships. Recommended default.

**Option C: Hybrid** — Sponsor ships hard-to-print items; volunteers print flyers locally.

---

## Sponsor support levels

**Level A: Single-mode pilot** — Fund one mode; ship 5–10 kits; volunteer commits to 2–3 events in 60–90 days.

**Level B: Kit + restock** — Initial kit + small refills after reporting thresholds are met.

**Level C: Multi-mode campaign** — Fund multiple modes in a coordinated campaign.

**Level D: Multi-city campaign** — 10+ cities; standardized reporting; compare results across locations.

## Quality governance

- All kits include a fixed version number and kit ID
- Volunteers agree not to alter messaging, make unapproved claims, or add partisan content
- Partner branding lives under `/partners/<partner>/` and requires explicit permission

---

## Measurement

Minimum per-event metrics (all modes):
- Mode used
- Materials distributed (estimate)
- QR scans
- Conversions (as defined by sponsor goal)
- Top questions asked
- What worked; what didn't; changes for next time
