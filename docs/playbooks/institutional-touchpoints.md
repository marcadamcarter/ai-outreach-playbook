# Mode 7: Institutional Touchpoints

**Effort: High Leverage · Frequency: Lower · Sponsor: Optional**

Engagement with formal structures — elected officials, schools, civic organizations. Influences decision-makers and legitimizes local efforts.

---

## When to Use This Mode

- You have access to a formal institution (city council, school, business group, civic org)
- You want to move from awareness-building to policy-adjacent influence
- You have a professional or academic background that gives you credibility in formal settings

---

## Volunteer Requirements

- Presenter or spokesperson: comfortable with formal briefing settings
- Commitment: varies by format (5-minute comment to 30-minute presentation)
- Credibility helps: professional background, local ties, or institutional affiliation

---

## Materials Kit

**Self-serve:**
- 1-page briefing document
- 5–10 minute verbal talk
- City council comment script (under 3 minutes; see below)

**Sponsor-supported additions:**
- Professional briefing deck (5–10 slides)
- 30-minute extended version
- Printed leave-behind
- Speaker prep support

## City Council Comment Script (3 minutes)

> "My name is [name] and I'm a [city] resident. I'm here to ask that [council/mayor's office] become aware of the AI oversight conversation happening at the state and federal level and its potential impact on our community.
>
> AI systems are being deployed in ways that affect municipal services, employment, and public safety — often without adequate governance frameworks. Several cities and states are beginning to address this proactively.
>
> I'm not asking for specific policy action today. I'm asking that someone on your staff take 20 minutes to understand what's happening and be available to engage with residents on this topic.
>
> I'm happy to provide materials and follow up. Thank you."

## Institutional Contexts

### City Council and Local Government
Use public comment periods to raise AI oversight as a constituent concern. See the [contact-elected-officials playbook](https://github.com/Marc-Outreach/ai-outreach-playbook/blob/main/playbooks/contact-elected-officials.md) for detailed scripts and contact lookup.

**What to ask for:** Awareness, staff touchpoint, briefing invitation.

### School Presentations
Contact via department chair or civics/social studies teacher. Frame as "current events" or "digital citizenship." Aim for 20–30 minutes with Q&A.

### Organizational Briefings
Request 10–15 minutes on an existing agenda. Frame as relevant to the organization's interests. Prepare for: "What do you want us to do about it?"

---

## 1-Page Briefing Document Structure

1. The situation (2–3 sentences)
2. Local relevance (2–3 sentences)
3. What other jurisdictions are doing (2–3 bullet points)
4. Our ask (1–2 sentences; specific, modest, actionable)
5. Contact information
