# Mode 1: Static Presence

**Effort: Low · Reach: Passive · Sponsor: Optional**

Passive material placement that works while you're not there. No direct engagement required — relies on curiosity and foot traffic.

---

## When to Use This Mode

- You want to build baseline awareness with minimal time investment
- You have access to high-foot-traffic locations (coffee shops, libraries, campuses, laundromats)
- You're not ready for direct conversation but want to contribute
- You're seeding a new city or neighborhood before other modes launch

---

## Volunteer Requirements

- No facilitation skills required
- Commitment: 1–2 hours to place materials; occasional restocking
- Works solo; no coordination needed

---

## Materials Kit

**Self-serve (print yourself):**
- High-contrast poster (11x17 or larger); single message per asset
- QR card or business-card drop (3x4 or wallet size)
- Sticker sheet for bulletin boards

**Sponsor-supported additions:**
- Professionally printed posters with bleed and UV coating
- Pre-cut QR sticker rolls
- Display stands or frames

### Kit Design Rules (from the 3-Layer Message Model)
1. Hook: 2–5 words (e.g., "AI Risk Is Real")
2. Core idea: one sentence
3. Action: QR code with short URL

Assets that add a fourth element should be rejected.

## Step-by-Step Setup

1. **Identify locations.** Target: coffee shops, libraries, community boards, campus kiosks, laundromats, gyms, barbershops. Aim for dwell time of 5+ minutes.
2. **Ask permission.** Most venues require verbal or written OK. Frame it: "I have a nonpartisan public interest flyer about AI policy — would you be willing to display it?"
3. **Place materials.** Put posters at eye level. Business card drops go near registers or entry tables. QR stickers go on bulletin board edges.
4. **Log the location.** Record venue name, date placed, contact name, material type. Use this for restocking.
5. **Restock every 2–4 weeks.** Check that materials are still up and readable.

## Talk-Track (If Asked)

Most static placements involve no conversation. If someone asks while you're placing materials:

> "I'm placing informational flyers about AI safety policy — it's a nonpartisan topic that doesn't get a lot of local coverage. No ask except to scan the QR if you're curious."

---

## Success Metrics

- Number of locations with active placements
- QR scan rate from placement-specific codes
- Duration materials remain in place

Report these in your After-Action Report. Use a separate QR code per venue cluster to track which locations drive engagement.

---

## AAR Notes

When filing your AAR for this mode, note:
- Location type (coffee shop, library, campus, etc.)
- Number of placements active
- QR scan count since last report
- Any venues that removed materials (and why, if known)
