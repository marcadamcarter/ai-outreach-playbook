# Mode 2: Signal Actions

**Effort: Very Low · Reach: High Visibility Bursts · Sponsor: Optional**

Short-duration, high-visibility presence. Your "corner sign" model. Maximum impression per minute of effort.

---

## When to Use This Mode

- You want high visibility without sustained commitment
- You want to test messages quickly before investing in larger formats
- You have access to a busy intersection, overpass, or venue entrance
- You have 15–30 minutes and a few people willing to show up

---

## Critical Success Factor

**Legibility beats passion.**

A sign read at 40 mph by 500 cars beats a perfectly crafted paragraph read by 5 people. Every design decision must serve readability, not self-expression.

---

## Volunteer Requirements

- No facilitation skills required
- 1–4 people per session; more creates visual impact
- Commitment: 15–30 minutes per session
- Works independently or with a small group

---

## Materials Kit

**Self-serve:**
- Foam board signs (22x28 minimum); black text on white or yellow
- Markers (3" chisel tip minimum) for hand-lettered versions
- Optional: printed vinyl banner for repeating locations

**Sponsor-supported additions:**
- Professionally printed corrugated plastic signs (24x36)
- Vinyl banner with grommets for overpass or fence display
- Pre-printed sign inventory for regional deployment

### Approved Headlines

These have been validated for 2-second readability:
- "AI Risk Is Real"
- "Pause Before It's Too Late"
- "Who Controls Superintelligence?"
- "Ask About AI Safety"
- "AI Needs Oversight Now"

### Design Rules
- 3–5 words maximum per sign face
- No paragraph text; no bullet lists
- High contrast only: black on white, black on yellow, white on red
- Secondary QR code optional (bottom corner, 2" minimum)
- Must be readable in 2 seconds at 40 mph; test this before your session

## Step-by-Step Setup

1. **Choose your location.** Busy intersections with red lights, pedestrian-heavy areas, overpass railings (where legal), venue entrances before large events. Check local ordinances on sign holding in public rights-of-way.
2. **Verify legality.** Most jurisdictions allow sign-holding on public sidewalks. Overpass banners and median standing may require permits. Know your local rules.
3. **Brief your group.** Everyone holds signs facing traffic. No verbal engagement required; the sign does the work. Volunteers do not debate, argue, or engage with hostile responses.
4. **Run the session.** 15–30 minutes is typical. Stay on public property. Be courteous.
5. **Log the session.** Record location, date, headcount, approximate vehicle/pedestrian count, and any notable reactions.
6. **Rotate messages.** Use different headlines across sessions to test which drives more QR scans.

## Talk-Track (For Pedestrian Encounters)

If someone stops and asks:

> "We're raising awareness about AI safety policy — it's a nonpartisan issue that affects everyone. Here's a card with more information if you're interested." [hand QR card]

Do not engage in extended debate on the sidewalk. Direct to QR. Move on.

---

## Success Metrics

- Sessions run per month
- Estimated impressions (vehicle count × session minutes / dwell estimate)
- QR scan lift on session days vs. baseline
- Message variants tested

---

## AAR Notes

When filing your AAR for this mode:
- Location and duration
- Headcount and sign variants used
- Estimated traffic volume
- QR scan count (if session-specific QR used)
- Any notable interactions or incidents
