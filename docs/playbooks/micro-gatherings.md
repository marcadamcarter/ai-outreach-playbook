# Mode 4: Micro-Gatherings

**Effort: Low Scale · Reach: High Depth · Sponsor: Optional**

Small group engagement with structured discussion. Moves people from awareness to conviction. Develops future volunteers.

---

## When to Use This Mode

- You want to go beyond handing out flyers into real conversation
- You have access to a casual venue (coffee shop, library meeting room, church space)
- You're comfortable leading or co-leading a 10–15 minute structured talk
- You want to develop local advocates, not just informed bystanders

---

## Volunteer Requirements

- Facilitator: comfortable leading a brief structured conversation
- 3–12 attendees is the ideal range
- Commitment: 1–2 hours total (prep + session)
- No expertise required — the structured format handles it

---

## Materials Kit

**Self-serve:**
- Printed discussion outline (1-page)
- Printed 1-page "start here" explainer for attendees
- Optional: simple slide deck (5–8 slides)

**Sponsor-supported additions:**
- Professionally designed slide deck
- Printed handouts in quantity
- QR cards linking to curated reading list

### Slide Deck Structure (if used)
1. The speed of AI development (1 slide; 1–2 data points)
2. What's at stake (1 slide; human oversight framing)
3. What local action looks like (1 slide)
4. Discussion question (1 slide; leave on screen during discussion)
5. What you can do next (1 slide; QR + specific asks)

## 10–15 Minute Session Structure

**Minutes 0–2: Framing**
> "Thanks for being here. This isn't a lecture and I'm not an expert — I'm just someone who thinks this topic deserves more local conversation."

**Minutes 2–8: Core content**
Three points:
1. AI systems are developing faster than the policy frameworks governing them.
2. The decisions being made now about oversight and control will matter for decades.
3. Local voices have historically shaped national policy when they show up consistently.

**Minutes 8–10: Discussion question**
> "What happens if AI development outpaces our ability to understand and govern it — and what, if anything, do you think people like us should do about it?"

**Minutes 10–15: Concrete next step**
Give one clear ask: attend a future event, sign up as a City Lead, or share with one person.

## Discussion Prompts (Backup)

- "What would you want to know before trusting an AI to make a high-stakes decision?"
- "Do you think most people in this city know this conversation is happening?"
- "What's one thing you think local residents could realistically do?"
