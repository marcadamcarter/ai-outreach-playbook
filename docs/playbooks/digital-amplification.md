# Mode 5: Digital Amplification

**Effort: Asynchronous · Reach: Unlimited Scale · Sponsor: Supported**

Every physical interaction should route here. Digital amplification multiplies the impact of every other mode.

---

## When to Use This Mode

- You want to extend the reach of physical outreach beyond the event
- You need a QR destination that's worthy of the curiosity you've generated
- You want to enable people to share the message in their own networks
- A sponsor is building or funding digital infrastructure

This mode is rarely standalone — it's the destination that all other modes point to.

---

## Volunteer Requirements

- Content curator: comfortable evaluating and selecting readable, non-academic sources
- Optional: someone with basic web skills to manage a landing page
- Commitment: initial setup + periodic content updates (monthly)

---

## Start Here Page (Required)

Every QR code in this system should point to a "Start Here" page.

### Requirements
- 2–5 minute read maximum
- Written for a general audience; no academic jargon
- Non-partisan framing throughout
- One clear call to action at the bottom

### Structure
1. **The situation** (2–3 sentences)
2. **Why it matters locally** (2–3 sentences)
3. **What you can do** (3–5 bullet points)
4. **Trusted sources** (3–5 links; non-academic; diverse)

### What to Avoid
- Long introductions about AI history
- Speculative doomsday scenarios
- Academic citations without explanation
- Embedded video as the only content

---

## Short Video Structure (Optional)

1. **Hook (0–10 sec):** A question or provocative statement
2. **Problem (10–40 sec):** AI is moving fast; oversight is lagging
3. **What people are doing (40–90 sec):** Show local outreach
4. **Call to action (90–120 sec):** One ask

Keep it under 3 minutes. Authenticity beats production value.

---

## QR Code Strategy

- Use a unique QR code per campaign, location cluster, or event
- Route through a redirect (not direct to final URL) so you can update destinations without reprinting
- Track scan rates by QR code
- Review analytics monthly; retire underperforming placements
