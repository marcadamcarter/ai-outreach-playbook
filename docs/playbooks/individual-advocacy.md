# Mode 6: Individual Advocacy

**Effort: Zero Coordination · Reach: Personal Networks · Sponsor: Not Required**

For individuals who want to act independently — no event, no booth, no schedule.

---

## When to Use This Mode

- You want to contribute without attending events or coordinating with anyone
- You're comfortable raising AI safety as a topic in natural conversation
- You want to share information in your workplace, family, or friend group
- You're an introvert who prefers one-on-one over public-facing formats

This mode requires no sponsor, no kit, and no coordination.

## Materials Kit

**Self-serve (everything you need):**
- 1-page explainer (printable or shareable as PDF)
- 3 talking points (memorize or keep on your phone)
- 1 short video link (2–3 minutes; shareable)
- 60-second explanation guide (verbal script; see below)

---

## The 3 Talking Points

1. **The speed point:** AI systems are advancing faster than the regulatory and oversight structures designed to govern them. The gap is widening.

2. **The stakes point:** The decisions being made now — about who controls these systems, how they're used, and what limits exist — will shape outcomes for decades.

3. **The access point:** Most people don't know this conversation is happening at a policy level. Awareness itself is the first step.

## 60-Second Explanation Guide

> "So AI development is moving really fast right now — faster than most people realize. The concern isn't just about sci-fi scenarios. It's more practical: the systems that are being built today are starting to make decisions that affect people, and the oversight structures — the policies, the laws, the accountability mechanisms — haven't kept up. That gap is what a lot of researchers and policy people are focused on. I've been trying to understand it better and thought it was worth raising."

## Step-by-Step Approach

1. **Know your moment.** Good openings: when AI comes up naturally, when someone mentions a tool, when news creates an opening. Don't force it.
2. **Use a question, not a statement.**
   - "Have you thought about who's responsible when an AI system makes a bad call?"
   - "Do you think most people understand how fast AI is developing?"
3. **Give a 60-second frame, then stop.** Let them respond.
4. **Share the resource.** If they're interested: "I can send you the link."
5. **Don't argue.** If they're skeptical, let it go.

## Workplace Conversations

- Frame as "something I've been reading about"
- Stick to informational framing; avoid policy debates
- Don't bring it up repeatedly with the same person if they weren't receptive
- Lunch and hallway conversations work; staff meetings do not

---

## Digital Sharing

**High-signal:** Direct message with a brief personal note. Comment on a relevant post with a link and one-sentence framing.

**Low-signal:** Mass-posting without context. Arguing in comment threads.

Quality of share matters more than quantity.
