# Pitch: ai-outreach-playbook

## One sentence

A modular local outreach system for AI safety awareness — seven deployment modes, from placing a flyer in a coffee shop to briefing a city council — with sponsor-controlled kits for modes that need them and self-serve guides for those that don't.

---

## The problem

Most people will not start their learning journey by reading long reports or listening to hours of content. They will accept a flyer, scan a QR code, and ask a couple of questions when they are already out at an event. They'll share a short video a friend sent. They'll remember a sign they saw at an intersection.

Today, motivated volunteers who want to do any of this must reinvent materials, messaging, and operational structure from scratch. Quality and consistency suffer. There is no shared infrastructure.

---

## The concept

A modular system where:
- **Self-serve modes** (Individual Advocacy, Static Presence, Signal Actions) give motivated individuals everything they need to act without waiting for anyone
- **Sponsor-supported modes** (Interactive Booths, Digital Amplification) give organized efforts the quality and measurement infrastructure they need to scale
- **Hybrid modes** (Micro-Gatherings, Institutional Touchpoints) can run either way depending on what's available

Every mode uses the same communication standard — the 3-Layer Message Model — and routes to the same measurement infrastructure (QR tracking, after-action reports).

---

## Why the user-group parallel

I personally saw how user groups flattened the learning curve for unfamiliar technology:
- Predictable cadence (monthly)
- Low-pressure first contact
- A clear next step (resources, subscribe, join, attend)
- Shared materials and simple talk-tracks
- Local leaders running the work with minimal central overhead

This playbook applies that pattern to public-facing AI risk awareness — extended across all the formats in which people actually encounter ideas in communities.

## The 7 Modes

| Mode | Effort | Sponsor needed? |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| Static Presence (flyers, QR stickers) | Very low | Optional |
| Signal Actions (corner signs, flash presence) | Very low | Optional |
| Interactive Booths (tabling at events) | Moderate | Supported |
| Micro-Gatherings (coffee shop discussions) | Low-moderate | Optional |
| Digital Amplification (landing pages, QR destinations) | Async | Supported |
| Individual Advocacy (workplace, personal conversations) | Zero | Not required |
| Institutional Touchpoints (city council, schools, civic orgs) | Variable | Optional |

---

## How sponsors engage

Sponsors do not run events and do not coordinate field operations. Sponsors:
- Choose which modes to fund (most sponsors start with Interactive Booths + Digital Amplification)
- Approve messaging once; ship standardized kits to vetted City Leads
- Provide QR landing pages and tracking links
- Receive measurable reporting (QR scans, conversions, common questions, what worked)
- Iterate only when data suggests a clear improvement

---

## How success is measured

Every mode routes to the same measurement layer:
- QR tracking (per-mode, per-location codes)
- After-action reports (standardized template)
- Conversions defined by sponsor goal

Example restock threshold for Interactive Booths:
- 2 events completed
- 50 total QR scans
- 10 conversions
- AARs submitted for each event

---

## Why this works across multiple sponsors

This repo is organization-neutral. Different initiatives can ship their own kit variant and landing page while using the same operational playbook, volunteer infrastructure, and reporting structure.

---

## Next step for interested sponsors

1. Decide which modes you want to support
2. Define your call-to-action (what QR should drive)
3. Define your minimum kit contents for each mode
4. Open an issue: **Sponsorship: \<Org Name\>**
