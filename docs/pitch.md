# Pitch: ai-outreach-playbook

## One sentence
A volunteer-led, user-group-style outreach system for tabling at local events; sponsors ship standardized, high-quality physical kits (flyers, QR cards, stickers, signage) while local leaders do the execution and report measurable results.

## The problem
Most people will not start their learning journey by reading long reports or listening to hours of content. They will accept a flyer, scan a QR code, and ask a couple questions when they are already out at a community event. Today, motivated volunteers who want to do local outreach must reinvent materials, printing, and messaging from scratch; quality and consistency suffer.

## The concept
A sponsor-controlled “Tabling Kit” model that local leaders can run monthly:
- Sponsors control the message and print quality by producing and shipping kits.
- City Leads focus on the actual work: securing booths, staffing tables, and having respectful one-on-one conversations.
- QR landing pages provide a clean “next step” and allow tracking.
- After-action reports create a feedback loop to improve the kit and prove what works.

This is not a street-corner model. It is a recurring community event model; art walks, First Friday events, farmers markets, campus fairs, conferences, and meetups.

## Why I think it will work (the user group parallel)
I personally saw how user groups flattened the learning curve for unfamiliar technology:
- predictable cadence (monthly)
- low-pressure first contact
- a clear next step (resources, subscribe, join, donate, attend)
- shared materials and simple “talk tracks”
- local leaders running the work with minimal central overhead

This playbook applies that pattern to public-facing AI risk awareness.

## What makes this sponsor-friendly
Sponsors do not run events and do not coordinate booths. Sponsors:
- approve the message once
- ship standardized kits to vetted City Leads
- receive measurable reporting (QR scans, conversions, common questions, what worked)
- iterate only when data suggests a clear improvement

This keeps the sponsor’s core production team out of operational work.

## Roles

### Local City Lead (volunteer)
City Leads handle:
- identifying and booking events (vendor booth or informational booth)
- staffing the table (solo or with helpers)
- using sponsor-provided materials as-is
- submitting an After-Action Report within 72 hours of each event

Recommended commitment:
- 2 to 3 events in 60 to 90 days (monthly cadence preferred)

### Sponsors / partners
Sponsors handle:
- producing and shipping Tabling Kits (quality and message control)
- providing QR landing pages and tracking links
- optional restocks based on demonstrated activity and reporting

## The sponsor “Tabling Kit” (what I’m asking you to provide)
Minimum viable kit (physical):
- Flyers (high quality stock)
- FAQ handout (1 page or half-sheet)
- QR cards (business card size; durable)
- Stickers (optional but high engagement)
- Table signage (folding tabletop sign or rigid sign)
- Volunteer talk-track card (30 seconds; 2 minutes; 5 minutes)
- One-page setup/instructions sheet and reporting checklist

Optional upgrades:
- corrugated plastic signs
- volunteer shirts
- giveaway items (stickers, buttons, shirts.)
- “hard questions” card (for volunteers only)

Each kit should have a version number (e.g., v1.2) and kit ID for tracking and iteration.

## What I will deliver
For an initial pilot:
- operate 2 to 3 events over 60 to 90 days using sponsor-provided kit materials
- publish After-Action Reports in this repo (metrics + common questions + what changed)
- produce a City Lead playbook that other cities can follow without reinventing anything
- recommend kit refinements based on real event feedback

## How success is measured
Minimum per event:
- flyers/QR cards handed out (estimate)
- QR scans
- conversions (as defined by sponsor goal; signups, joins, subscriptions, donations, etc.)
- top questions asked
- what worked; what failed; what changes next time

Example “unlock” threshold for restock support:
- 2 events completed
- 50 total QR scans
- 10 conversions (definition depends on sponsor goal)
- After-Action Reports submitted for each event

## Why this can support multiple efforts without forcing one brand
This repo is organization-neutral. Different initiatives can ship their own kit variant and landing page while using the same operational playbook and reporting structure. That allows sponsors with different tones and calls-to-action to benefit from the same volunteer infrastructure.

## Next step
If you are interested in piloting this approach:
- decide what your QR should drive (subscribe, join, donate, attend, learn)
- define your minimum kit contents
- ship one kit for the Corpus Christi pilot
- I run the pilot and report results; we refine based on data
