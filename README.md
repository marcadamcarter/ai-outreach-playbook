# ai-outreach-playbook

Volunteer-led community outreach playbook and print-ready kit for tabling at local events; flyers, QR landing pages, talk tracks, and simple metrics to run repeatable pilots and scale across cities.

## What this is
This repository is a practical “user-group style” outreach system for AI risk awareness:
- Lower the barrier to entry for people unfamiliar with AI risk and governance topics.
- Create a repeatable, low-friction on-ramp (short explanations; QR follow-through).
- Make the work easy for local leaders to run monthly.
- Measure outcomes so sponsors can fund what works.

This is not a stand-on-a-street-corner model. It is a community event model; art walks, First Friday style events, campus fairs, farmers markets, conferences, and meetups.

## Why it should work (the user group parallel)
I previously helped launch a PowerShell user group community in Texas. The pattern that made that ecosystem grow is the same pattern this playbook is built on:
- predictable cadence (monthly is ideal)
- friendly “first exposure” experience
- a clear next step (join, learn, subscribe, participate)
- local leaders with shared materials
- lightweight central support that does not require a core media team to execute events

## The pitch in one paragraph (for sponsors)
Local volunteers run the actual outreach. Sponsors provide a small set of centralized assets once (print-ready PDFs, banner files, and a mobile landing page) plus optional micro-grants after results are demonstrated. The output is measurable (QR scans, signups, repeat attendance), and the model is replicable across cities.

## Roles and expectations

### Local City Lead (volunteer)
The City Lead handles:
- finding and booking events (vendor booth or informational booth)
- printing and bringing materials
- staffing the table (solo or with helpers)
- collecting metrics and submitting an after-action report

Recommended “skin in the game” for early pilots:
- $100 to $200 out-of-pocket to print initial flyers and signage
- after traction is proven, sponsors can optionally reimburse or provide small micro-grants

### Sponsors and partners (low lift)
Sponsors do not run events. Sponsors can support by providing:
- a standardized outreach packet (approved messaging and design assets)
- a simple, mobile-friendly landing page and tracking method
- optional reimbursements or micro-grants for active cities, after metrics meet a basic threshold

## What sponsors can provide (the “packet”)
Minimum viable packet:
1) **Flyer (1 page, print-ready PDF)**; QR code plus 30-second explanation
2) **FAQ sheet (1 page, print-ready PDF)**; answers to common questions
3) **Table QR signage (small)**; “Scan to learn more” plus a short hook
4) **Mobile landing page**; designed for QR traffic and quick next steps
5) **Tracking**; unique QR per city/event (UTM params are fine)

Optional upgrades:
- retractable banner artwork
- stickers
- volunteer shirt artwork
- a short “talk track” card (30 seconds; 2 minutes; 5 minutes)
- one-page “What you can do next” card (subscribe; join; donate; local meetups)

## What this repository includes (planned structure)
This is a suggested structure; adjust as the kit evolves.
