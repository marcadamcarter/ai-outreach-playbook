# ai-outreach-playbook

Sponsor-shipped tabling kits plus a volunteer playbook for local, recurring community events; designed to be measurable, repeatable, and easy to replicate across cities.

## What this repo is
This repository is a practical outreach system for local “tabling” at events like [Corpus Christi First Friday Art Walk](https://downtowncorpuschristi.org/events/first-friday-artwalk), farmers markets, campus fairs, and conferences.

Core idea:
- Sponsors control quality and messaging by producing and shipping standardized physical kits.
- Local City Leads do the work; book events, staff the table, and have respectful one-on-one conversations.
- Results are measured via QR tracking and short after-action reports; learn what works, then replicate.

## Start here
- Read the pitch: [`PITCH.md`](/pitch.md)
- Sponsor and fulfillment model: [`SPONSORING.md`](/sponsoring.md)
- Become a City Lead: [`RECRUITING.md`](/RECRUITING.md)
- Report results after each event: [`metrics/after-action-report-template.md`](/metrics/after-action-report-template.md)

## How it works
1) **Sponsor ships a Tabling Kit** (flyers, QR cards, stickers, signage; optional banner/tablecloth).
2) **City Lead runs 2 to 3 events** in 60 to 90 days (monthly cadence preferred).
3) **City Lead submits an After-Action Report** within 72 hours of each event.
4) **Sponsor iterates the kit** based on real questions, scan data, and conversion outcomes.

## Who this is for
### City Leads (volunteers)
People who can commit to showing up locally and running a table consistently.

### Sponsors and partners
Organizations that want measurable grassroots reach without putting their core team on event operations. Sponsors provide standardized kits, a QR landing page, and tracking.

## Repo map
Typical contents (will evolve as the kit matures):
- `assets/print/`  
  Print-ready PDFs and production files for sponsor kits.
- `talk-tracks/`  
  Volunteer talk tracks (30 seconds, 2 minutes, 5 minutes) and FAQs.
- `landing-pages/`  
  Copy and structure for mobile-first QR landing pages.
- `metrics/`  
  After-action templates and examples.
- `playbooks/`  
  Step-by-step guides for City Leads; event setup, posture, do and do not lists.
- `partners/`  
  Optional partner-specific variants; only with explicit approval for branding.

## City Lead quick start
1) Open an issue: **City Pilot Request: <City, State>**
2) Identify a recurring event and confirm booth availability.
3) Commit to 2 to 3 events and agree to reporting expectations.
4) Receive sponsor kit; run the table; submit AAR after each event.

## Sponsoring quick start
1) Read: [`SPONSORING.md`](/sponsoring.md)
2) Open an issue: **Sponsorship: <Org Name>**
3) Define:
   - your call-to-action (what QR should drive)
   - your minimum kit contents
   - your fulfillment approach (direct shipping, vendor fulfillment, hybrid)
   - your reporting threshold for restocks (if any)

## Content and brand notes
- This repo is organization-neutral by default.
- Partner branding should only be added with permission and kept under `partners/`.
- City Leads should not modify sponsor-provided messaging or introduce unapproved claims.

## Contributing
Issues and PRs are welcome. High-value contributions:
- clearer flyer copy for non-technical audiences
- better QR landing page flow
- volunteer talk tracks that reduce debate and increase follow-through
- improvements to the AAR template and reporting consistency
