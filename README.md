# ai-outreach-playbook

A modular system for local AI risk awareness outreach. Seven deployment modes — from placing a flyer in a coffee shop to briefing a city council — each with its own playbook, effort level, and sponsor posture.

## What this repo is

A practical toolkit for anyone who wants to raise local awareness about AI oversight and safety policy. Modes range from zero-coordination individual advocacy to sponsor-supported tabling operations at community events.

Core principles:
- Match the mode to the volunteer's situation and commitment level
- Sponsors control messaging quality when they're involved; self-serve modes work without them
- Every mode routes to a measurable outcome (QR tracking, after-action reports)
- Learn what works, then replicate

## The 7 Modes

| # | Mode | Effort | Reach | Sponsor needed? |
|---|------|--------|-------|-----------------|
| 1 | [Static Presence](playbooks/static-presence.md) | Very low | Passive | Optional |
| 2 | [Signal Actions](playbooks/signal-actions.md) | Very low | High-visibility bursts | Optional |
| 3 | [Interactive Booths](playbooks/interactive-booths.md) | Moderate | Deep engagement | Supported |
| 4 | [Micro-Gatherings](playbooks/micro-gatherings.md) | Low-moderate | High depth | Optional |
| 5 | [Digital Amplification](playbooks/digital-amplification.md) | Async | Unlimited scale | Supported |
| 6 | [Individual Advocacy](playbooks/individual-advocacy.md) | Zero coordination | Personal networks | Not required |
| 7 | [Institutional Touchpoints](playbooks/institutional-touchpoints.md) | High leverage | Decision-makers | Optional |

See [core-model.md](core-model.md) for the strategic rationale behind each mode.

3. Action: QR code or next step

Assets that add a fourth element should be rejected. See [core-model.md](core-model.md).
